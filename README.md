Work in progress, for now nothing to show :D

## build
To build project use this commands:
```
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make
```
To build with debug prints add `-DDEBUG=ON` to `cmake`. You can add `-DDEBUG_LEVEL=<0..5>` for different debug prints and `-DENABLE_TESTS=ON` to build test application.
